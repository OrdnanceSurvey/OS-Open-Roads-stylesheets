# OS Open Roads

These are **LYR** files for OS Open Roads in **ESRI Shapefile** format for use in **ESRI ArcGIS**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Roads-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Open a new blank map in ArcMap

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference

**4.**  Select the layer file and click ‘Add’

**5.**  Your Table of Contents should now look like this. This is the recommended layer order:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:250** and **1:100,000** for maximum legibility
