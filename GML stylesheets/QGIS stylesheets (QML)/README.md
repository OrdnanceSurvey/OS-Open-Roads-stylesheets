# OS Open Roads

These are **QML** files for OS Open Roads data as supplied in **GML/GZ** format for use in **QGIS**.

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Roads-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Load your Open Roads GML data into QGIS

**3.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the relevantly named QML file > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

Repeat step 3 for all layers.

We recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the Open Roads data between **1:250** and **1:100,000** for maximum legibility

Your data should now look similar to this:
